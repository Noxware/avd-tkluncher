# AVD TkLuncher

Simple Python GUI for running existing Android Virtual Devices without opening Android Studio.

This project can be used without installing any additional Python package. It is very minimal and uses Tkinter for the GUI (but with help of a personal project called Tkbetter).

This project is currenty incomplete and the code is a bit ugly and messy. I will fix everything after ending the development of my [Tkbetter](https://github.com/Noxware/tkbetter) project.
But actually it does the job.
